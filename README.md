# TheBlogSpot
A blog for free minded thinkers!
User story - As a creative person and a blogger, I want an open forum where I can post about anything I want. I would also like my friends and family to able to read my posts and comment. Also, the user should have the option of editing or deleting their own messages.

# Installation
***This app is currently incomplete, to run: clone development branch into local repo and run "npm i" to install, "npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000" to run json server, and then "npm run start". Both json-server and npm run start should be run after CDing into the client folder in the development branch.
